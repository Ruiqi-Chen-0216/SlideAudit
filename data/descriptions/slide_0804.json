While he does act with great courage, he is still hidden away, inside the annex, while Miep and Mr. Kraler must come and go constantly, which puts them at risk of being spotted by the Nazis. In Act One, Scene Two, Anne refers to the two Dutch people as their protectors. This indicates that they are the ones keeping the occupants of the annex safe. Despite Mr. Frank’s great bravery, Miep and Mr. Kraler willingly put themselves in harm’s way, making them the most courageous characters in the play."
