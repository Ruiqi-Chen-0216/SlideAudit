Like if you have $500, you have the choice to buy Tesla shares from all your budget, but it will be risky if Tesla shares go to loss. You will also get a loss in just one hit at Tesla shares, but if you purchase also Audi and Ford shares, if Tesla shares go to loss, you will get profit from other shares.\nIf you are unable to diversify plan for your money you can contact with Behavioral Finance."

      "textContent": "The Key Benefits Of Diversification Include Risk Reduction\nDiversification helps minimize the overall risk of your portfolio by reducing the impact of any single investment's underperformance.\nIf one investment or asset class experiences a downturn, other investments in your portfolio may perform well, offsetting the losses.\nImproved Return Potential\nA diversified portfolio can provide a more stable and consistent return over the long term, as different investments may perform differently in various market conditions.\nBy allocating your investments across different asset classes, you can potentially capture the upside potential of higher-risk investments while balancing them with lower-risk, more stable investments."
