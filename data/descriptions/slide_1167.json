Use the attached sheets to view some sample climatograms. You will need to GATHER as much background information as possible to create your own. A climatogram is a graphical representation that shows the amount of precipitation and the average temperature per month of a given biome. Both variables are plotted on the same graph to show how they relate to each other. The data on the climatogram must be accurate. The months of the year should occupy the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis should be Temperature and amount of precipitation respectively. Temperature should be plotted with one color, and precipitation should be plotted in a different color."
