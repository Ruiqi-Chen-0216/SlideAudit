Award for BES PECASE winners codified ($50k/yr for 5 years) .  BES solicitations have allowed more young investigators to be funded.\nDiversity\nRecommendation:  BES should collect demographic data on gender, race, and career-stage and efforts should be made to ensure a diverse work force.\nActions:  SC-wide demographic data collection system “in progress;” CSGB co-sponsored gender and URM equity in chemistry workshops with NSF and NIH."
