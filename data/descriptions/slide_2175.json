Through our work, we will continue this legacy and join in the stewardship of the original people's land and recognize that our policy recommendations, proposed projects and programs impact the lives of all people who live, learn, and work on Indigenous land.\nThis acknowledgment only becomes meaningful when coupled with accountable relationships and informed action. We are committed to building public awareness and support of tribal sovereignty and advancing equity among tribal and urban Native communities through our actions.\n3"
